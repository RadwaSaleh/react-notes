Basics:

- React is all about components 
- In React we write declarative javascript code which means we define the goal (what should be shown on the screen) and let React figure out how to get there.
- We always build a component tree with one root component 
- JSX is html code in javascript file
- JSX gets compiled to JS behind the scenes
