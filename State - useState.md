- State generally refers to application data or properties that need to be tracked among components.
- Just because you change a variable, React won't update a component.
- useState is a React hook
- React Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Instead by using a Hook inside
 the existing function component
- useState is responsible for rerendering the enclosing component when a property/data I specify changes
- Hooks must be called in a React function/component function.
- useState returns an array with exactly two items:

  The `current state` of this state variable, initially set to the `initial state` you provided.
  The `set function` that lets you change it to any other value in response to interaction.
